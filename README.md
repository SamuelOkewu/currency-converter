💰 Currency Converter Application
A clean, responsive web application for fetching real-time exchange rates and converting amounts between various world currencies.

✨ Features
This application provides a fast and reliable way to handle currency conversions, relying on up-to-date exchange rates from a dedicated external API.

Real-Time Conversion: Instantly converts an amount based on the latest exchange rates.

Comprehensive Currency Support: Supports conversion for a wide range of global currencies (dynamically populated from the API).

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with clear input fields and selection dropdowns for source and target currencies.

Robust Error Handling: Displays clear messages if the exchange rate API call fails (e.g., due to network issues or rate limits).

🛠️ Technologies Used
The project is built using a standard web stack:

HTML5: For the application structure.

CSS3: For styling and ensuring a responsive layout.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the core conversion logic, API interaction, and DOM manipulation.

External API: Utilizes a third-party Exchange Rate API (e.g., Fixer or ExchangeRate-API) to fetch current data.
